In The assessment I have counted all the considerations mentioned in the following:

-  The assessment is written in swift.
-  The users search list UI is created with UIKit and RxSwift/RxCocoa for the reactive framework.
-  The user detail page UI is created with SwiftUI and combine for the reactive framework. 
-  The app built to work reactivelty over a REST api built with RxSwift
-  The app works online by fetching data from the API.
-  MVVM-c is the architcutre pattern.
-  The app is operating in Landscape and portrait. 
-  The app performs in both a dark and light mode.
-  The user can search for Github users using search bar in user list screen (searching subject: username/login). 
-  The items list gets refreshed with pull down.
-  The internet disconnection will be detected reactively, and when the network connection is back, the user can simply pull down the list for refresh. 
-  The activity indicator shows up with every search request until the result is ready. 
-  When a user from the search result is selected, a user details page will appear showing the image, username and number of stars for the selected users.
-  aplly unit test to api requests and stars count functionality
